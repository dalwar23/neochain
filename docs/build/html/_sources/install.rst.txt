=======
NEOChain requires Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7. If you do not already have a Python environment configured on your
computer, please see the python page `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ for instructions on installing Python environment.

.. :note::

   if you are on Windows and want to install optional packages (e.g., scipy) then you will need to install a python
   distribution such as `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy>`_
   or `Pyzo <https://www.pyzo.org>`_. If you use one of these Python distributions, please refer to their online documentation.
