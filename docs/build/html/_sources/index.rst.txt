Welcome to `NEOChain <https://www.neochain.readthedocs.io>`_
============================================================

NEOChain (``neochain``) is a Network Evolution Observation library for Blockchain networks. This specially designed `python` library
can provide tools to detect community structures in massive networks like **Blockchain** and also capable of merging one or
more timed snapshot of transaction data into one large snapshot without losing any nodes to better understand the evolution of
the network.

Overview
=========
`NEOChain <https://www.neochain.readthedocs.io>`_ is a specially designed python package for observation of evaluation
of network in **Blockchain** networks. It can also handle networks other than blockchain. This package facilitates -

- Fast and memory efficient community detection in large-scale graphs
- Selection of top `N` detected communities in any timed snapshot of the graph
- Creation of sub-graphs based on detected communities
- Merging of graphs and sub-graphs based on detected communities
- Finding similarity measures between a pair of communities
- Finding the most similar pair of communities

With NEOChain you can detect communities and observe network evolution over time.
